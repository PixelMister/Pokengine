Player - Set the icon that indicates the player\u2019s current location on the map. Selector - Define the hover state graphic shown when the player hovers over a location on the map.</p> <p>Begin by uploading a background image for your region map. Here\u2019s an example using the Kanto region.</p> <p></p> <p>Recommended Dimensions: 260 x 228 pixels is the suggested size for your region map image. However, this is not a strict rule - you can choose to make it smaller or larger depending on your design.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If your image is larger than 260 x 228:     The region map will be displayed inside a fixed canvas of 260 x 228 pixels. Players will need to drag and scroll the map to explore different parts since the entire image won\u2019t fit on screen at once.</p> </li> <li> <p>If your image is smaller than 260 x 228:     A black border will appear around the map, similar to how the Retro Kanto map looks.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Map Amount</p> <p>The game supports only one region map per region. For example, if you plan to add a DLC zone later within the same region, you won\u2019t be able to display a different map image for it. Keep this limitation in mind and plan accordingly when designing your region map.</p> <p>Kyledove's Tip</p> <p>I always design my region maps on a grid to help organize locations and plan routes clearly. For instance, I avoid diagonal paths since players can\u2019t walk diagonally, and those routes are tricky to create clickable selection areas for.</p> <p>In the example below, I used an 8x8 pixel grid for general layout, with cities sized at 16x16 pixels. Generally, I stick to multiples of 8 for region maps - this keeps everything neat and consistent.</p> <p>Also, be sure not to make your clickable areas (hit boxes) too small - they need to be visible and easy to click, or players might get frustrated trying to select locations!</p> <p></p> <p>The grid overlay is actually super useful for pulling out exact coordinates! If you save this image and open it in a photo editing tool, you can hover over locations to get their pixel coordinates. For example, I opened it in MS Paint, hovered over the top-left corner of Pallet Town, and it showed the coordinates 55,142.</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Utilities/region-map-setup/#locations-setup","title":"Locations Setup","text":"<p>Using these coordinates, you can start building the entries for the Locations section in your region map setup.

This can differ from the internal map name used in Mapbuilder.</p> </li> <li> <p>Coordinates - The x,y pixel position on your region map grid (top-left corner of the selectable area).</p> </li> <li> <p>Selectable Area Size - The width and height of the clickable area in pixels (e.g., 8x8).</p> </li> <li> <p>UID (optional) - The unique ID linking to your map in Mapbuilder, connecting the region map location to the actual map.</p> </li> <li> <p>Fly (optional) - Indicates the location is a valid Fly destination in-game.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Optional Parameters</p> <p>As mentioned above, the UID is optional. This means you can start building your region map locations even if you haven\u2019t created the actual maps in Mapbuilder yet \u2014 neat and flexible! For example, \"Pallet Town: 58,146,8x8\" is perfectly valid syntax.</p> <p>Sometimes, your route might be split into multiple sections, or you may have multiple locations with the same name. The system supports this by allowing you to add identifiers using the <code>#</code> symbol. See the example below:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Route 104#1: 18,122,8x24=08x7hzjy  </p> </li> <li> <p>Route 104#2: 18,106,8x8=08x7hzjy</p> </li> </ul> <p>In this case, Route 104 in Hoenn is divided by Petalburg, so instead of one large clickable area, it\u2019s split into two separate zones distinguished by  <code>#1</code> and <code>#2.</code></p> <p>For the player, none of this complexity is visible - they just see one seamless region map experience.</p>"},{"location":"Utilities/region-map-setup/#player-and-selector-setup","title":"Player and Selector Setup","text":"<p>This part is completely up to you, but feel free to use some of our existing assets.</p> <p></p> <p>The selector we provide is specifically designed for 8x8 tiles.
