# Request a Feature

Can't find how to do `[x]` in the code library? You’re probably not alone - and yes, we do take feature requests! We're always working to expand the engine’s functionality to support developers like you. The best part? When something is added, it benefits everyone. To request a new feature, please contact an admin.

!!! warning "We're a Non-Profit Project"

    Pokengine is a non-profit project maintained by a very small team. While we welcome requests, we’re currently working through a large backlog of features and improvements. That means new requests may take a while to review and even longer to implement. We prioritize based on how critical a request is, so lower-priority items could take months before they’re reviewed or implemented.

If the functionality you’re requesting isn’t essential, we recommend considering a workaround, an alternate approach, or possibly setting the idea aside for now - we don’t want to be a blocker on you finishing or releasing your project.

!!! info "Plan Ahead"

    For features that aren't functional yet but are on the long-term roadmap (like a daycare, contest or other major systems), we recommend planning ahead in your region design. Even if the feature doesn’t work yet, reserving space for it now will make things much easier later. Just like you wouldn’t build a Pokémon’s moveset using only currently functional moves, you shouldn’t limit your region layout to only what works today. Thinking ahead makes future updates much easier to integrate. 

!!! info "Official Features"

    Standard Pokémon features - like contests, berry growing, and similar mechanics - are already on our roadmap and don’t need to be requested. We’re actively working on them as part of the core engine development.
