# Current Limitations
We know the engine isn’t perfect - and there are definitely areas where it could be better. Here’s a look at some of the rough spots we’re aware of and hoping to improve:

- Ability to create folders in tilefuser.

- Ability to create folders in mapbuilder for sprites.

- Read but not write view of a region.

- Share root objects with other people.

- Static encounter tab in mapbuilder similar to trainer battles but for a single mon.

- Root objects to be able to come prefilled so you can edit the base code and fill in the blanks.

- If a scene (battle background) is set to private, only the creator can use it. If someone who doesn't have access to that scene edits the battle, it wipes it.

- Confusion around mapbuilder roles and the powers they have (Mapping Editor, etc)

If you have any ideas or notice other areas where Mapbuilder could improve, please let us know - we’re always eager to hear your feedback!
