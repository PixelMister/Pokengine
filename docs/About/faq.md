## How do I play the MMO?
- Follow the instructions in the message you received when you joined. You can validate your account by running the `/access` bot command in the <#1029551492845273179> channel. This will bring up a prompt to enter your username and password from the Pokéngine website (**NOT** your Discord username and password). Once your username turns orange, it means you now have beta access.

- Login to the site and go to <https://pokengine.org/mmo> and click **Play**. From there, you can log in with your Pokéngine username and password.

- When you first load in, you will spawn in the **HUB Region** which provides a short tutorial for how to play the game. After you complete the tutorial, you can continue 
exploring HUB or choose another region by visiting the [Airport](<https://pokengine.fandom.com/wiki/Airport>) to the north.

 ▶️ A walkthrough of the tutorial can be found [here](<https://pokengine.fandom.com/wiki/HUB_Island#Tutorial_Walkthrough>).

- **Still can't play?**
  - Remember to login with the Pokéngine username you registered with. Access is granted to that account. Do not create a new account.

  - Can't login or forgot your username/password? Your username should be the same as your nickname in this server. Use the `/password` command if you forgot your Pokéngine password.

  - Pokéngine is best supported and experienced on Chrome, Edge, or Firefox.

  - Check if your internet connection is stable.

## How do I move these windows on my screen?
On computer, the game works with many widgets! The default setup might look messy on some computers. Drag the widgets to your preference by clicking and holding with the right mouse button. A single right mouse button click lets you close widgets and brings up other options.

For tablet users, it is suggested you force mobile mode by enabling it in the settings by typing `/settings` in the game chat widget. Look for the **Force Mobile** option.

- **Are the widgets resizeable?**

  - The game window has three separate zoom levels. You can drag the corner of the window or change the zoom level via settings.

  - The chat window can be resized to your liking by dragging the corners or edges.
  
  - The Dex widget can only have its height adjusted.

All other widgets currently cannot be resized.

## Can I download the game?
No. The game is currently unavailable for download or offline play. The website and server are run and hosted on a computer. The game requires an internet connection as it is based on data gathered from the website and is constantly being updated in real time.

## How do I use Pokéballs and other items?
Most items can be dragged to the game screen to use them. You may also choose to right click on them and click "Use". (On mobile, tap and hold until the option pops up).
