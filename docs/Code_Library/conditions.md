### Party Has
Additional Party Conditions for advanced party control.

```json 
partyHas[searchFor|collections|copyright|eggGroups|evolutions|slot|species|tags|types|mon]
```

1 if the condition is true, 0 otherwise.

This only accepts 1 param, a string containing multiple sub parameters.

The conditional string accepts a wide array of potential values.

Each condition is separated by &, and is treated as an “and” conditionally.

Most/all conditions can be used multiple times (just not “searchFor”)

Spacing is allowed if it helps legibility, though avoid using it in the value for the “mon” condition.

`if partyHas[searchfor=any & evolutions = 1 & slot = 1]`

Is a valid value, and translates to “Any mon in the party that has an immediate evo and is in the first slot.”

Below is documentation for each sub parameter/conditional capable of being used.

**searchFor**
Accepts “any” or “all” as valid values.

Defaults to “any” if not specified at all.

Preferably the first condition, this specifies how the condition should behave.

“any” - Find if there is ANY mon in the party that meets ALL the conditions in this check.

“all” - Check to see that ALL mons in the party meet ALL the conditions in this check.

`if partyHas[searchfor=all&type=bug]`

Would be ‘true’ if the player’s party is entirely pokemon that are at least bug type.

**collections**
Accepts any number of UIDs of collections the mon/mons may be from, separated by commas.

If specified, no matter how many acceptable collections are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them.

`if partyHas[collections=10f6gxci,10hvquu7]`

Would be “Any mon that is in the HUB OR Rica collections”

**copyright**
Whether or not the mon/mons should be copyright.

Often used to identify Nintendo mons.

`if partyHas[copyright=1]`

Would mean “if the player’s party has ANY copyright mon”

**eggGroups**
Accepts names of egg groups separated by commas.

The egg groups you want the mon/mons to belong to.

`if partyHas[eggGroups=mineral,water 2,field]`

Would be “Any mon that belongs to AT LEAST ONE of the egg groups: mineral, water 2, or field”

**evolutions**
Accepts whole numbers or whole numbers that are preceeded by `>,>=,<,<=`

The number of IMMEDIATE evolutions the mon/mons should have.

`if partyHas[evolutions=>=1]`

Would be “Any mon that has one or more possible immediate evolutions

**slot**
Accepts whole numbers (1 to 6) or whole numbers (1 to 6) that are preceeded by `>,>=,<,<=`

The slot the mon should be in.

Do not attempt to use this with searchfor=all as it will not work.

`if partyHas[slot=>=4]`

Would be “any mon exists in the 4th, 5th and 6th slots.”

`if partyHas[slot=4&type=ground]`

Would be “If the player has a ground type in their 4th slot”

**tags**
Accepts any string values separated by commas.

The tags the mon should have in the pokengine database site.

If specified, no matter how many tags are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them, not ALL of them.

Tags ARE case sensitive here.

`if partyHas[tags=King,knight]`

Would be "If the party has any mon that has the tag ‘King’ OR ‘knight’"

**types**
Accepts any number of types by name separated by commas.

If specified, no matter how many types are provided, the mon/mons must belong to AT LEAST ONE of them, not ALL of them.

`if partyHas[types=bug]`

Would be “any mon that has the type bug”

`if partyHas[types=bug,ground]`

Would be “any mon that has the type bug OR ground”

`if partyHas[types=bug&type=ground]`

Would be “any mon that has the type bug AND ground”

`if partyHas[searchfor=all&types=bug,ground]`

Would be “All mons in party are at least bug OR at least ground”

`if partyHas[searchfor=all&types=bug&types=ground]`

Would be “All mons in party are at least bug AND ground”

**mon**
Accepts a value very similar to a mon generation string, with a few slight variances.

Each of these sub-conditions are separated by ; and their sub-sub-condition values are separated by commas (see the ivs in the examples below)
