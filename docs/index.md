This document serves as the definitive guide to region development on Pokengine. This guide covers everything you need to understand regarding Pokengine’s custom programming language **jCoad.** as well as information regarding Tilefuser and Mapbuilder usage.

# Introduction
## What is Pokengine?
Pokengine is a community-driven platform focused on creating custom content, such as Regions or Dexes. It also offers a browser-based MMO that merges all the user-created content into one expansive game, though Regions can be kept separate and turned into standalone games if their creators prefer. 

At its core, Pokengine is an engine, not a game itself. The game aspect is built by the users, meaning Pokengine isn’t just one game but a collection of many, all rolled into one.

The engine provides a suite of online, browser-based tools specifically designed to help users edit and build their own game worlds.
