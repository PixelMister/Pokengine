# Publishing your Region

It’s been a real labour of love, but you’ve finally reached the point where you’re ready to release your Region.

**First things first: How do you want to launch it?**
Do you want to shadow-drop it as a surprise, or build anticipation with an announcement ahead of time? If you’re going the announcement route, think about how far in advance you want to tease it - do you want to hint at it slowly, or go for a big splash?

**Most creators opt to write up a short announcement** for us to post in the #announcement channel on Discord. We’ll also update the in-game “message of the day” to let players know it’s live. Just reach out to an Admin when you're ready.

## The Process
To officially publish your region, follow the steps below:

1. **Set up your Intro Map**
 In the Region Settings in Mapbuilder, paste the UID of the map you want players to land in when they enter your Region.
 
 **Don’t do this until you're 100% sure you're ready to go live.** Once this field is filled in, the Region is considered public.

2. **Add an Outline**
 This is the short line that Zeppelina will say to players at the Airport. It gives them a quick idea of what your Region is about. **Keep this line brief or it will get cut off!**

 ## Region Description for the Airport Terminal
 We also ask for a slightly longer blurb for the Airport Terminal notice board. This should be about four sentences long and give players a fuller sense of what to expect.

    Please do let an Admin know before you release your Region, even if you plan to shadow drop it.
