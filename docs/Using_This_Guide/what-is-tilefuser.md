# What is Tilefuser?
Tilefuser is Pokengine’s software to create a map image using sprite tilesets. Anyone can use Tilefuser to create and share maps. If you have permission you can also upload your own tilesets through Tilefuser and implement your Tilefuser maps into the game using Mapbuilder, a separate program.

This section of the online Pokengine Documentation will walk you through the process of creating a map, sharing maps you’ve made, and uploading tilesets.
