# Move Relearner & Tutor (How-to)

!!! note
    Detailed code can be found in the **Code Library** â€“ this page is just for examples and tips.

If you want a PokÃ©mon to relearn a move it has already passed in its level-up set, there are several ways to do this:

- **Via the Party Menu** â€“ No restrictions, no item required, no cost.  
- **Via an NPC** â€“ Some NPCs may offer move relearning services.

!!! note
    The same syntax is used for Move Tutors!

## Via the Party Menu

Simply add this to your Region Vars:

```plaintext
var[move_learner_context]=1
```

## Move Relearner NPC Example  
*(Item Required â€“ Uses a Heart Scale to reteach a move)*

```plaintext
%random%=npc(013flqt5,down)
%random%.msg(I can help your Pokemon relearn a move that it has forgotten, if you give me a Heart Scale! Would you like to have a Pokemon relearn a move?)&answers=Yes,No

if item[0683drku]
Yes=%random%.answer()&movelearner=max:1;cost:0683drku 1;
No=%random%.answer()
else
Yes=%random%.answer(But you don't have any Heart Scales...)
No=%random%.answer()
```

!!! note
    Our move relearner is designed to show **every move** in a PokÃ©monâ€™s level-up set â€“ even ones that are above its current level.  
    Those higher-level moves will appear **greyed out** and cannot be selected.  
    This gives players visibility into what their PokÃ©mon can learn in the future.

## Move Tutor NPC Example

```plaintext
%random%=npc(01qplyfm,up)
%random%.msg(Can you imagine?#If this volcano were to erupt?|The explosion would be the end of us. How terrifying is that?|While we're terrified, would you like me to teach Explosion?)||&answers=Yes,No
Yes=%random%.answer(You're terribly brave!|Which Pokemon should I teach Explosion?)&movelearner=moves:07nhrhjt
No=%random%.answer(Yeah, you're right.#It is too terrifying.)
```

!!! note
    The Move Tutor screen will still appear even if a PokÃ©mon **cannot learn** any of the listed moves â€“ those moves will simply be greyed out.  
    Depending on how you've set it up, you may be able to scroll through your entire party to see which PokÃ©mon are eligible to learn the move(s).
