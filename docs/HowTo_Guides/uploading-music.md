## Uploading Music
**Optional Step: Downloading from SoundCloud**
If you found a song you like on SoundCloud, you can use [KlickAud](https://www.klickaud.co/) to download it in `.mp3` format.

1. **Upload your MP3 to Dropbox**
    * Right-click the file > Share

    * Click Create link > Copy link

    * Example link:
        `https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/69vowblrn64j6bes6mi8s/TomsDinerBW.ogg?rlkey=hjonbnsh93vzne572kuozv12h&st=pa462te2&dl=0`

2. **Convert the Dropbox Link**
    * Replace everything before the file ID with `db:s/`

    * Replace all instances of & in the link with `^` (This step is only necessary if you are adding the Dropbox link to jCoad)

    * Final format:
       `db:scl/fi/69vowblrn64j6bes6mi8s/TomsDinerBW.ogg?rlkey=hjonbnsh93vzne572kuozv12h^st=pa462te2^dl=0`

3. **Paste this link into Pokengine - refer to Music Settings page**

We have a [central music repository](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Xyfc4jBWfXcuyLiJx3uErtb6lZyAsQ5ypMVCUBDzTt4/edit?usp=sharing) that anyone is welcome to take from or contribute to.

!!! warning "Broken Links"

    Since music is externally hosted, thereâ€™s always a risk that links may break or stop working in the future. Unfortunately, Pokengine does not currently support uploading `.mp3` files directly to the engine, so external hosting is the only option for now.
